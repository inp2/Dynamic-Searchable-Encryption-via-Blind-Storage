A privacy-protecting cloud encryption model based off the paper Dynamic Searchable Encryption via Blind Storage.
Please read more from the paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/219.pdf. An extension added to this method not stated in
the paper is the extra cache stored on the client that allows lookup to be slightly faster. We are looking into other 
approaches of making lookup faster, one including sending clumps of requests at the same time.
